# ecommerceBackend

## As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

## When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

## When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

## When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

## When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
